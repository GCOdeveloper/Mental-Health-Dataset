# Mental-Health-Datasets

The **DatasetMH.xlsx** excel corresponds to a corpus of mental health in social networks labelled with polarity and stigma. In particular, the corpus consists of 2,287 comments categorized by sentiment and stigma based on responses to Instagram posts regarding celebrities' mental health revelations:
1. Polarity: This involves assigning a positive, negative, or neutral/undefined value to comments made in response to the disclosure or description of symptoms in the post. Positive polarity indicates understanding, support, or even admiration for the post. Negative polarity is given when individuals express unfavorable views, often questioning the post with ironic, sarcastic, or derisive remarks.  Neutral  is assigned when there is no discernible opinion or when comments can be interpreted in multiple ways.
2. Stigma: stigmatising responses to comments are behaviours in which negative beliefs and emotions towards MH problems are expressed.

The file **DatasetMH_Emotions.xlsx** corresponds to a corpus of mental health in social networks labelled with emotions. In particular, the corpus consists of 2,287 comments labelled with five emotions plus a neutral class from comments on Instagram posts about celebrity mental health disclosures. These emotions are:
+ Love/admiration: This emotion involves messages where admiration, approval and love are closely related.
+ Gratitude: the messages imply a sincere appreciation for sharing mental health-related content on social networks. 
+ Comprehension/empathy/identification: The messages involve interest in and understanding of the message, including self-identification with the situation or context.
+ Sadness: This primary emotion is produced by events that are not pleasant and that denote heaviness. It includes many manifestations of pity for the person.
+ Anger/contempt/mockery: This emotion involves responses of irritation and attacks on the person as ridiculous and superficial.
+ Neutral: This category corresponds to messages without emotions.

The ethical dimensions of artificial intelligence in social sciences are becoming a crucial issue and working with mental health issues in social networks raises ethical concerns of privacy and ethical protocols. As a consequence, our study has been conducted following the guidance of various scholars on the application of artificial intelligence in social sciences, emphasizing the importance of result interpretability and ensuring transparency in the design of algorithms and datasets. Therefore, only public posts and comments were chosen, and comments were carefully anonymized by removing @mentions, names, usernames, and URLs. Furthermore, the dataset was processed to exclude any identifiable information or sensitive content that could compromise user privacy, adhering to the principle of data minimization by collecting only the data strictly necessary for our research purpose. These data will be used exclusively for the purposes of this research and for no other purpose. The accounts used were strictly public, ensuring that no private data was accessed or utilized. This approach allows us to ensure that data collection and usage are conducted ethically, respecting user privacy, avoiding bias and discrimination, maintaining transparency. In this way, our collected data complies with the principles of purpose limitation, transparency, data minimization, and the prevention of discrimination and harm. Finally, this research received formal approval from the Ethics and Deontology Committee of the University of Valladolid (PI 23-3365), ensuring its adherence to the standards of ethical conduct and academic integrity.
