# Mental-Health-Datasets

The **DatasetMH.xlsx** excel corresponds to a corpus of mental health in social networks labelled with polarity and stigma. In particular, the corpus consists of 2,287 comments categorized by sentiment and stigma based on responses to Instagram posts regarding celebrities' mental health revelations:
1. Polarity: This involves assigning a positive, negative, or neutral/undefined value to comments made in response to the disclosure or description of symptoms in the post. Positive polarity indicates understanding, support, or even admiration for the post. Negative polarity is given when individuals express unfavorable views, often questioning the post with ironic, sarcastic, or derisive remarks.  Neutral  is assigned when there is no discernible opinion or when comments can be interpreted in multiple ways.
2. Stigma: stigmatising responses to comments are behaviours in which negative beliefs and emotions towards MH problems are expressed.

The file **DatasetMH_Emotions.xlsx** corresponds to a corpus of mental health in social networks labelled with emotions. In particular, the corpus consists of 2,287 comments labelled with five emotions plus a neutral class from comments on Instagram posts about celebrity mental health disclosures. These emotions are:
+ Love/admiration: This emotion involves messages where admiration, approval and love are closely related.
+ Gratitude: the messages imply a sincere appreciation for sharing mental health-related content on social networks. 
+ Comprehension/empathy/identification: The messages involve interest in and understanding of the message, including self-identification with the situation or context.
+ Sadness: This primary emotion is produced by events that are not pleasant and that denote heaviness. It includes many manifestations of pity for the person.
+ Anger/contempt/mockery: This emotion involves responses of irritation and attacks on the person as ridiculous and superficial.
+ Neutral: This category corresponds to messages without emotions.
